<p class="noindent">SCENE. <i>A Room in</i> <span class="fs70">JULIET'S</span> <i>Flat. Back centre, a fire. To its right, a
chair; to its left, an easy chair and a small table. Two envelopes and a new
novel lie on the table.</i> <span class="fs70">JULIET</span> <i>is seated in the easy chair, looking into the fire</i>.</p>

<p>
JULIET (<i>dreamily</i>). Hans Andersen, when he was old and frail,<br />
Said that his life had been a fairy-tale.... (<i>Looking up.</i>)<br />
That's what mine is! Think of it&mdash;by a freak<br />
Of Fortune to be famous in one week,<br />
And with my first book! Would it have made quite<br />
Such a commotion had I dared to write<br />
Under my name? Who knows? But if you've penned<br />
A merciless portrait of your dearest friend,<br />
You simply can't avow it. And a book<br />
That bears a man's name has a weightier look<br />
Somehow. My novel! Why, it seems an age<br />
Since last I gloated on the title-page. (<i>She takes up the novel from the table.</i>)<br />
'The Strong Man's Library. Number Seventeen.<br />
"Calypso and Her Loves," by Galahad Green.<br />
Second Impression.' Then down there, quite small.<br />
The modest publishers&mdash;Chapman and Hall.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Turning to the envelopes on the table.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">
Oh, and they've sent me&mdash;Is it from Chapman? Yes&mdash;<br />
Another batch of cuttings from the Press.<br />
Quite a lot, too! I'll give them just a glance<br />
Before I go to supper.<br />
</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>Taking the envelope which is on top, she extracts a number of Press
cuttings, looks through them hastily and tosses them back on to the table
one by one.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="pad10">'<i>True romance.</i>'</span><br />
W. J. Turner&mdash;'<i>Shows a man's desire<br />
To write for men.... Much promise.</i>' J. C. Squire.&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
'<i>At times like Gosse....</i>' Who wrote that? Squire again,<br />
But in a different paper&mdash;'<i>Stuff for men....<br />
Gosse-like at moments.</i>' Edward Shanks&mdash;'<i>No learner,<br />
A finished craftsman.</i>' W. J. Turner&mdash;<br />
'<i>Impressive.</i>' J. C. Squire.&mdash;'<i>His novel ranks<br />
Among the best books of the season....</i>' Shanks.&mdash;<br />
'<i>Impressive.</i>' Shanks.&mdash;'<i>Almost the true Gosse fire....</i>'<br />
Turner again. '<i>A man's book.</i>' J. C. Squire.&mdash;<br />
My poor head swims! How very queer to find<br />
Ten papers, three reviewers and one mind.<br />
They're like the Isle of Man. Suppose I beg<br />
Prettily? Would they make me their fourth leg?<br />
Here's praise enough. Indeed, you'd think I knew them&mdash;<br />
Or that they hoped I might in turn review them.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Looking again at the table, she picks up the second envelope.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">
And here? Oh, horror! Helen's writing&mdash;hers,<br />
I'm sure, and what wild spluttering characters!<br />
Their wildness might be due to haste, but not<br />
The Maenad fury of that final blot.<br />
She's read the book, and recognized with rage<br />
The portrait of herself on every page,<br />
In every line. She couldn't miss it. Why<br />
Didn't I make Calypso small and shy,<br />
Dark and not fair? Whatever made me draw<br />
Helen complete, even to her slightest flaw?<br />
Everything's there&mdash;green eyes, the Chelsea flat,<br />
The craze for Morny bath-salts, even that!...<br />
I let Calypso live at such a pace<br />
Too, that I daren't look Helen in the face,<br />
I simply daren't. But stay! She might have seen<br />
The book: she can't think I am Galahad Green.<br />
There's hope. I'll soon see what she has to say.... (<i>She opens the letter.</i>)<br />
'My dearest Juliet'&mdash;'dearest,' anyway!&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
'I'm furious, but I shan't say what about<br />
Until we meet. Promise you won't be out<br />
This evening. I shall call at eight o'clock.<br />
Helen.' At least her letter saves the shock<br />
Of meeting unprepared, and I'll be able<br />
To sweep these wretched cuttings from the table<br />
What <i>is</i> the time? Exactly eight. Oh dear,<br />
At any minute now she may be here<br />
Storming my ears off. What a risk I took!<br />
And then&mdash;she's just the girl to read a book,<br />
Find her own portrait there, done all too well,<br />
And taxi-ing to the publishers pell-mell<br />
Demand to have the author's home-address.<br />
Chapman and Hall, however great their stress,<br />
Would never give it, would they? When we met<br />
Their manager seemed such a perfect pet....<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>A bell rings. Noise outside.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">
There she is.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="fs70">HELEN</span> <i>rushes in&mdash;still wearing her furs</i>.)</p>

<p>HELEN (<i>dramatically</i>). Juliet!</p>

<p>JULIET. <span class="pad4"> Well, what's wrong, my dear?</span></p>

<p>HELEN. Nothing&mdash;at least&mdash;I <i>am</i> so glad you're here.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She takes both of</i> <span class="fs70">JULIET'S</span> <i>hands</i>.)</p>

<p>JULIET. I read your letter just in time. The fact<br />
Is that it caught me in the very act<br />
Of going out to supper.</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad4">But you'll stay</span><br />
Now? It's important&mdash;what I've come to say&mdash;<br />
And yet so horrible that I've scarce the heart<br />
To speak of it. I don't know how to start.</p>

<p>JULIET. I guess. You've jilted John! I always said<br />
You would. Or has he jilted you instead?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
HELEN (<i>breaking</i>). Oh, don't be flippant, Juliet. Can't you see<br />
It's not a laughing matter? Should I be<br />
In such a state about a love-affair?<br />
I'm not pre-Shaw.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">Then why&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">As if I'd care</span><br />
Because John tried to leave me. He'll as soon<br />
Do that as find an oil-field in the moon.<br />
No&mdash;this is something serious.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">Won't you take</span><br />
Your furs off, and sit down?</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad4">For goodness' sake</span><br />
Don't vex me with that calm superior tone!<br />
Once you were sympathetic, but you've grown<br />
More and more selfish every month. Of late<br />
I've hardly seen you. <i>Now</i> I come here straight<br />
From being insulted, being driven half-mad,<br />
By some sly undiscoverable cad,<br />
And there you sit, impassive and content,<br />
Like Middle-Age upon a monument<br />
Smiling at grief.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">I don't flare up like you,</span><br />
Helen. But wait! I've been insulted, too.</p>

<p>HELEN. Really? But listen! If I keep it back<br />
A minute more, it means a nerve-attack.<br />
Juliet&mdash;I've read a book&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad6">A novel?</span></p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad8">Yes&mdash;</span><br />
A new one. But however did you guess?<br />
It's only just out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
JULIET.<span class="pad4">Surely you can't mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>HELEN (<i>holding up a copy</i>). 'Calypso and Her Loves'!</p>

<p>JULIET (<i>doing likewise</i>).<span class="pad2">By Galahad Green!</span><br />
Now, that's extraordinary&mdash;the very same!</p>

<p>HELEN. You've read it? Oh, it makes me blush for shame.</p>

<p>JULIET. Stick by me&mdash;even now. I know you will.</p>

<p>HELEN. What? I? Dear Juliet, you can love me still!</p>

<p>JULIET. To see them set down&mdash;all one's little tricks....</p>

<p>HELEN. To have one's soul supplied at eight-and-six....</p>

<p>JULIET. Or hired from Mudie's, read by every clerk&mdash;</p>

<p>HELEN. And every sniggering waitress after dark.</p>

<p>JULIET. I could have stood a mere divorce. But this!</p>

<p>HELEN. Every one <i>must</i> know who Calypso is.</p>

<p>JULIET. Of course. I simply daren't be seen about.</p>

<p>HELEN. Who <i>is</i> this Galahad Green? I can't find out.</p>

<p>JULIET. A blood-sucker, a literary flea!</p>

<p>HELEN. I'll sue the cad for libel. Just you see!</p>

<p>JULIET. You dear! It ought to be <i>my</i> action, though.</p>

<p>HELEN. Yours? You can't mind as much as I, you know.</p>

<p>JULIET. Can't I! You think I'd stay in England now?</p>

<p>HELEN. What? Leave your home? No, that I can't allow.</p>

<p>JULIET. Won't you come, too? To-morrow I shall start.</p>

<p>HELEN. Of course you're sweet to take it so to heart&mdash;</p>

<p>JULIET. Who wouldn't&mdash;with her reputation gone?</p>

<p>HELEN. It must be such a bitter pill for John!</p>

<p>JULIET. What would John care because I'm painted black?</p>

<p>HELEN. You?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">In this book, this dastardly attack&mdash;</span><br />
Yet, you dear noble girl, at least it's shown<br />
That to you my misfortunes are your own.</p>

<p>HELEN. Juliet&mdash;what <i>do</i> you mean? Sometimes your gibes<br />
Are most ill-timed. You know the book describes<br />
Me.</p>

<p>JULIET. You're not serious?</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad4">I? Of course I am....</span><br />
And now that I've discovered what a sham<br />
You were with all your sympathy, I could hurl<br />
The foul book at your head. You heartless girl!<br />
Is this a time to mock me, to pretend<br />
You care so much about your slandered friend<br />
That you won't stay in England? If that's your<br />
Notion of fun, it isn't mine, be sure.</p>

<p>JULIET. I wasn't being funny&mdash;not a bit,<br />
Really. It's simply that the cap does fit&mdash;<br />
I <i>am</i> Calypso!</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad4">Well, I never heard</span><br />
Such nonsense in my life. It's too absurd.<br />
Oh, if I could but think that one or two<br />
Readers might fancy it was meant for you,<br />
I'd take some pleasure in my life again,<br />
Dance, have a feast of oysters and champagne,<br />
Buy a new winter frock and hat, instead<br />
Of wishing, as I do, that I were dead.<br />
For you deserve it&mdash;you that make a joke<br />
Out of my misery.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">Helen&mdash;when I spoke</span><br />
Of being Calypso, didn't I, to my shame,<br />
Own the wild sins that cluster round her name?<br />
Alas, I meant it.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad4">Nobody could be</span><br />
So blind as not to know it's me&mdash;I&mdash;me:<br />
And since you're now my enemy, I shall go<br />
At once. But after this, I'd have you know,<br />
Our friendship's dead&mdash;for always! Please forget<br />
You ever knew me.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">Helen, don't go yet....</span></p>

<p>HELEN. I must. And let me say that if you call<br />
To-morrow you'll have wasted time, that's all.<br />
I shan't go home to-night.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">Where will you sleep?</span></p>

<p>HELEN. Battersea Bridge is high, and the Thames deep.</p>

<p>JULIET. You wicked child! You mustn't talk like that.</p>

<p>HELEN. A plunge and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">With such a pretty hat?</span></p>

<p>HELEN (<i>returning</i>). You never said you liked it.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">No. I've been</span><br />
So worried all day by this Galahad Green.<br />
For really, Helen, once and for all be certain<br />
It's not from <i>your</i> life that he's wrenched the curtain.<br />
You can still face the world. You've not the least<br />
Cause to abominate the loathsome beast&mdash;<br />
Except as I'm your friend: and since I know,<br />
Now, that your strange mistake has hurt you so,<br />
Believe me, I rejoice&mdash;yes, even rejoice&mdash;<br />
That I, not you, suffer by Galahad's choice.<br />
I bear it willingly. Must I prove my case?<br />
Give me one moment, while I find the place....<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She opens the book and searches through it feverishly.</i>)</p>

<p>HELEN (<i>opening copy</i>). Oh, if it comes to evidence...! But indeed<br />
I simply can't go through it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
JULIET.<span class="pad6">Let me read</span><br />
Page twenty-four: 'Between him and his wife<br />
A deep gulf lay. She wanted to see life<br />
Through her own eyes, but he preferred, she knew,<br />
The monocle of <i>The Saturday Review</i>'&mdash;<br />
There! Don't you see? That paper's just the one<br />
I always said would patronize the sun.</p>

<p>HELEN. That? Why, look here&mdash;page forty-two&mdash;'Her eyes<br />
Were green, her honey-coloured&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">Mere disguise!</span><br />
He <i>had</i> to change a little here and there.<br />
Listen: 'She glowered&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad4">'Her honey-coloured hair</span><br />
Lay in profusion on her shoulders&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">'Then</span><br />
She thought "It's time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad4">'To win the love of men&mdash;</span><br />
"What's that?" she cried. "I ever hated sin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>JULIET. "But now I'll change. To-morrow I'll begin....<br />
My sins are many. Can they be washed away?"'</p>

<p>HELEN. 'So she used Morny bath-salts every day.<br />
Often she'd sponge herself for hours, and dream<br />
Of love, veiled only by the bashful steam.<br />
Sometimes, perhaps, an over-amorous drop<br />
Would trickle down&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>JULIET (<i>shocked</i>).<span class="pad2">Helen, my dear&mdash;do stop!</span><br />
Really!</p>

<p>HELEN. But that's conclusive!</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad6">I admit</span><br />
That she had beauty, savoir-faire, and wit,<br />
But she was wicked, too, reckless and haughty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
HELEN. I can't pretend that I was never naughty.</p>

<p>JULIET. Naughty, perhaps; but you could never trip so<br />
Continually as Mr. Green's Calypso.</p>

<p>HELEN. I do believe you think I wouldn't dare<br />
Calypso's deeds. I've done them all&mdash;so there!</p>

<p>JULIET. Well, you shall have the truth. I'll make a clean<br />
Breast of it. Who, you ask, is Galahad Green?<br />
I know him!</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">Juliet! And he dares affirm</span><br />
That I was not.... The lily-livered worm!</p>

<p>JULIET. But if he writes a letter to the Press<br />
Declaring that he never saw you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">Yes,</span><br />
And makes me look a fool. What can I do<br />
When every one I meet says 'Is it you....<br />
That wicked gorgeous creature, that wild thing<br />
Ecstatic and unmoral as the Spring...?'<br />
Of course I owned it.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad6">Helen&mdash;I can still</span><br />
Save you. I'll make him write&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad4">No, no!</span></p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad6">I will&mdash;</span><br />
And now, at once. The telephone!</p>

<p>HELEN (<i>stopping</i> <span class="fs70">JULIET</span>).<span class="pad2">But I say</span><br />
You're not to!</p>

<p>JULIET (<i>struggling</i>). Let me go! We can't delay.</p>

<p>HELEN. Juliet, for goodness' sake don't be so dense!</p>

<p>JULIET. What <i>do</i> you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">Where's your intelligence,</span><br />
Your tact, your feminine intuition? Where<br />
Your sympathy? Must I lay my soul quite bare?</p>

<p>JULIET (<i>returning and collapsing into her chair</i>). So far as I'm concerned you're talking Greek.</p>

<p>HELEN. They've sold nine thousand copies in one week.</p>

<p>JULIET. Why, one would think, in spite of all that's passed,<br />
You liked the book.</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">So you've got there at last!</span><br />
You <i>are</i> an also-ran.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad6">Good heavens!</span></p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad8">I had</span><br />
To <i>say</i> that I was furious, and not glad;<br />
But what girl wouldn't feel some little stir<br />
Of pride when all the town's in love with her?<br />
You don't know half that's happened. This new novel<br />
Has simply made all other writers grovel.<br />
Bennett's gone mad with envy. J. C. Snaith<br />
Is in decline. Galsworthy's a mere wraith.<br />
Chesterton, having burnt his cap and bells,<br />
Drowned himself in a butt of Malmesey. Wells<br />
Vowed to the Press he'd never write again.<br />
May Sinclair, Violet Hunt, and Clemence Dane<br />
Have gone&mdash;forevermore to breathe the air<br />
Of Iceland. Poor Hugh Walpole's in despair.<br />
Now do you see my point? Didn't you lie<br />
When you said that Calypso wasn't I?</p>

<p>JULIET. Yes.</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">And the author learnt it all from you.</span><br />
I think you owe me something.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad6">Very true....</span><br />
What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
HELEN.<span class="pad6">Oh, Juliet&mdash;since I've been</span><br />
His model, do you think that Mr. Green<br />
Would possibly&mdash;just some day&mdash;take me out<br />
To supper?</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad4">When? To-night?</span></p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">Could he?</span></p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad8">No doubt.</span></p>

<p>HELEN. Let's ring him up.</p>

<p>JULIET (<i>stopping her</i>). Who said that <i>I</i> was dense?</p>

<p>HELEN. But if he's free&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad6">Use your intelligence,</span><br />
Your feminine intuition.</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">Yes, but how?</span></p>

<p>JULIET. Galahad does invite you here and now.<br />
All is not masculine that's Green.</p>

<p>HELEN (<i>collapsing</i>). Your book!</p>

<p>JULIET. Here are my notices, if you care to look.</p>

<p>HELEN. My dear!... And all those famous novelists, too&mdash;<br />
Just shrivelling up with jealousy of <i>you</i>!</p>

<p>JULIET. Ah, but the poets! They are delighted&mdash;they<br />
Whose rustic hearts envy could never sway.<br />
Read what they've said.</p>

<p>HELEN.<span class="pad6">I'm sure it's very sweet.</span><br />
But somehow I can never keep my seat<br />
On Pegasus.</p>

<p>JULIET.<span class="pad6">Pegasus! No one rides <i>him</i> now:</span><br />
But ah, how steadily up Parnassus' brow,<br />
With farmyard straw, not vine-leaves, in his hair,<br />
Squire Turner Pounds on Shanks's de la Mare!<br />

<hr class="full" />


<p class="noindent">SCENE. <i>The sitting-room of a flat in Knightsbridge. Back: centre, a fireplace
with fire burning; right, a cupboard containing tea things; left, a tall
lacquered screen. Front: a table on which are illustrated papers and a parcel
of books tied with string; a chair to each side of the table.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>The outside door is heard closing.</i></p>



<p>DOROTHEA (<i>without</i>). Kate!<br />
</p>

<div class="center">(<i>She enters, right, in a fashionable Spring walking costume.</i>)</div>

<p>
<span class="pad1">So I've caught her! Gone at half-past three&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Gone to 'the pictures' with her young man Bill.</span><br />
I hope she'll not be foolish.... Now for tea.<br />
</p>

<div class="center">(<i>She puts a kettle on the fire and brings a plate of cakes to the table.</i>)</div>

<p>
<span class="pad2">Ah! So the Mudie books have come&mdash;but still</span><br />
Nothing from James. He really is <i>too</i> shy&mdash;<br />
<span class="pad1">And Mother always whispers when we meet,</span><br />
'Well, dear, no startling news?' I wish he'd try!<br />
<span class="pad1">What have they sent me from New Oxford Street?</span><br />
'Poems,' by Marshlight.... Quite a charming face....<br />
<span class="pad1"><i>Four</i> portraits!... And how good it is to find</span><br />
A note that tells the very hour and place<br />
<span class="pad1">When each mouse-lyric shook that mountain mind!...</span><br />
And here? Oh Mudie! Sending <i>this</i> to <i>me</i>!<br />
<span class="pad1">'A Bed of Roses. George....' I'll try again....</span><br />
'Peeled Onions'! Now, whatever might <i>they</i> be?<br />
<span class="pad1">Of course! New tales by Ethel Colburn Mayne.</span><br />
How hypodermic! What she does without!<br />
<span class="pad1">What whittling of mere obvious fact! Indeed</span><br />
I sometimes tremble when her books come out<br />
<span class="pad1">For fear there won't be any words to read....</span><br />
The last two? These&mdash;hobnobbing all this time,<br />
<span class="pad1">Not rent to rags, not mutually destroyed?</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
For here's that famous work, 'Soul from the Slime,'<br />
<span class="pad1">By Jung, and here 'Slime from the Soul,' by Freud.</span><br />
They may be <i>risqué</i> but how up to date&mdash;<br />
<span class="pad1">And James need never know I've read them.... Stop!</span><br />
Surely? It is! A telegram! Oh, Kate,<br />
<span class="pad1">You little fool, to dump the books on top!</span><br />
Reply paid, too.... (<i>Reading</i>) 'Wylde, 15 Claridge Hill.<br />
<span class="pad1">Would you accept me for your husband? James....'</span><br />
At last!... What answer? If I say I will,<br />
<span class="pad1">The <i>Morning Post</i> will paragraph our names</span><br />
With me as 'Dorothea, second child'&mdash;<br />
<span class="pad1">Et cetera&mdash;and <i>The Tatler</i>, I expect,</span><br />
Will have a picture, 'Cupid's Bag. Miss Wylde,<br />
<span class="pad1">Sir James Adolphus Porter's bride-elect,</span><br />
A well-known figure both where Fashion reigns<br />
<span class="pad1">And where our young intelligenzia meet....'</span><br />
But shall I? If he read more, had more brains,<br />
<span class="pad1">More fire, and just a little less conceit!</span><br /></p>

<p>A VOICE (<i>behind the screen</i>). Marry him at your peril!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>not hearing</i>).<span class="pad4">He's a man</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Of wealth and rank&mdash;an O.B.E.&mdash;and yet</span><br />
To marry without love.... Some people can.<br /></p>

<p>THE VOICE.<span class="pad4">I gave you honest warning. Don't forget!<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>as before</i>). Most girls would jump at such an offer. Why<br />
<span class="pad1">Should I resent so much his pompous air,</span><br />
His embonpoint?<br /></p>

<p>THE VOICE.<span class="pad4">It isn't you, but I!<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>as before</i>). Or possibly, as Freud and Jung declare,<br />
Far under what we know ourselves to be<br />
<span class="pad1">Another self lies hidden. Am I, then&mdash;&mdash;</span><br /></p>

<p>THE VOICE. Like a volcanic island in the sea&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>half hypnotized</i>). Of which no more is visible to men<br />
Than the mere summit&mdash;fair with azure light<br />
<span class="pad1">And flowers and birds and grain to sow and reap&mdash;&mdash;</span><br /></p>

<p>THE VOICE. While the huge base goes shelving out of sight<br />
<span class="pad1">To coral-caves and monsters of the deep.</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. How queer to think that while one part of me<br />
<span class="pad1">Is almost fond of James, another part</span><br />
Is&mdash;doubtful&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>THE VOICE.<span class="pad4">Doubtful? Just you wait and see!<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Oh, for some ceremony, some magic art,<br />
To call up the subconscious mind!<br /></p>

<p>THE VOICE.<span class="pad4">Then hold</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Jung with your right hand, with your left hand Freud,</span><br />
And clap them thrice.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>following these directions</i>). Of course, I'm far too old....<br />
<span class="pad1">I ought to be more rationally employed....</span><br />
But still&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="fs70">DOROTHY WILD</span> <i>darts out from behind the screen. She is a barbaric figure
clad in furs and wearing a tiara of feathers.</i>)</p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">O-hai! And so at last I'm free!<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>recoiling</i>). Good gracious!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Don't you know me?<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad8">What's your name?<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Dorothy Wild. You end yours with an 'e'<br />
<span class="pad1">And spell it with a 'y'&mdash;as though for shame</span><br />
Of owning sisterhood with trees and birds<br />
<span class="pad1">And dragonflies; as though you'd never run</span><br />
Beside the foam, shouting ecstatic words<br />
<span class="pad1">In the wind's ear, nor let the immortal sun</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Have your whole body till Something, not of time,<br />
<span class="pad1">Like an elixir flowed through every vein.</span><br />
You? You lack pith. You'd never love through crime;<br />
<span class="pad1">But when <i>I</i> love, I dare&mdash;and brook no chain!</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. You're rather frightening. Still, do take a seat!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY (<i>sitting on the table</i>). Chocolates! One for me?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>politely</i>).<span class="pad4">Oh, not at all&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Wild roses, love and chocolate&mdash;aren't they sweet?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Yes&mdash;well ... I do hope nobody will call.<br />
We've not been introduced, but is it true<br />
<span class="pad1">That you're my own Subconscious?</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">There, you see</span><br />
The insolence of the Conscious! Part of you!<br />
<span class="pad1">Really! And why not you a part of me?</span><br />
How much of Time have <i>you</i> known? Twenty years;<br />
<span class="pad1">But I, whom not ten thousand can make old,</span><br />
Have worshipped trees, loved naiads, boxed the ears<br />
<span class="pad1">Of mountain satyrs, touched the Fleece of Gold,</span><br />
And ridden great centaurs. When I catch the strain<br />
<span class="pad1">Of Homer's verse I hear his very lyre</span><br />
Trembling: for me Hector is newly slain,<br />
<span class="pad1">And it was yesterday Troy fell in fire.</span><br />
They who at last have found me little guess<br />
<span class="pad1">Whither I lead. They fancy that one blow</span><br />
Has brought down Heaven in fragments. Nonetheless,<br />
<span class="pad1">I shall build what they think I overthrow!</span><br />
And you? You're just a weir that tames my power.<br />
<span class="pad1">I am the rushing car and you the brake</span><br />
That checks me: I the root and you the flower;<br />
<span class="pad1">I the true girl&mdash;&mdash;</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">Please try another cake.</span><br />
No doubt you're right, but Freud says&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Not a word</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Against my good Columbus!</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">Hardly! Still,</span><br />
I always thought from what I read and heard<br />
<span class="pad1">That you were quite a monster.</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">As you will,</span><br />
I have my faults.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">You do seem&mdash;shall I say</span><br />
<span class="pad1">A trifle&mdash;crude?</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">I'm what you'd like to be.<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Oh, really! I'm not prim&mdash;I'm rather gay&mdash;<br />
<span class="pad1">But that's no frock for going out to tea.</span><br />
I <i>should</i> blush!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Little hypocrite! Why, look&mdash;</span><br />
What's that&mdash;oh you that have no eyes for men?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. The 'Life of Gosse'&mdash;a very proper book.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. And underneath? La Vie Parisienne!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Turning to the bookshelves.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="pad1">Then, here's Boccaccio, Havelock Ellis, too,</span><br />
<span class="pad1">James Joyce rebound to look like Samuel Smiles,</span><br />
Montaigne, Pierre Louys&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">Any one but you</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Would know I read them only for their styles.</span><br />
I've stood enough. Please go!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">But where to go?</span><br />
<span class="pad1">We two make up one girl.</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">Behind the screen.<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Not yet!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. But I've important things&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">I know&mdash;</span><br />
That's why I came. This telegram, you mean&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Mind your own business!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">But it <i>is</i> mine, quite</span><br />
<span class="pad1">As much as yours. You'll take him? You insist?</span><br />
<i>I</i> won't!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. How terrible! In this modern light<br />
<span class="pad1">Poor James looks almost like a bigamist....</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Marry that hippopotamus if you dare!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Chairmen of Boards must be a little fat.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. James never rises but he 'takes' the chair.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. He owns five cars, four houses, and a flat.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Those and the seven deadly virtues, too.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. He's forty-nine and never loved before.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Why not? No girl would think of him but you.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. A solid quiet man&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad8">A solid bore!<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Now, Dorothy, be reasonable. Sit down<br />
<span class="pad1">Like a well-mannered girl, or&mdash;if you must&mdash;</span><br />
Crouch like a tigress there and fret and frown,<br />
<span class="pad1">But don't break in. I think it's only just</span><br />
That I&mdash;for, after all, I really am<br />
<span class="pad1">The civilized and reputable Miss Wylde&mdash;</span><br />
Should have the answering of this telegram.<br />
<span class="pad1">Say what you will, you're nothing but a child</span><br />
Who lies among the daffodils of Spring,<br />
<span class="pad1">Lost in a book of marvels. At a glance</span><br />
I know you&mdash;how you're dreaming of some king<br />
<span class="pad1">From over the blue mountains of romance</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Who'll set you on a charger black as night,<br />
<span class="pad1">And, spurring on by dragon-haunted caves,</span><br />
Come to his castle just when the sunset-light<br />
<span class="pad1">In Fairyland floats on the girdling waves.</span><br />
But kings aren't like that now. They puff cigars,<br />
<span class="pad1">Wear bowlers and check-suits, and fill the gaps</span><br />
Left between opening Parliament and bazaars<br />
<span class="pad1">By betting on the racecourse. Or perhaps</span><br />
You want some hero from a Conrad tale<br />
<span class="pad1">Who'd stand, white-ducked, against the torrid blue</span><br />
And shoot down tribes with bullets fast as hail:<br />
<span class="pad1">But think, my dear&mdash;he simply wouldn't do.</span><br />
Picture it. We should take him out to dine&mdash;<br />
<span class="pad1">The ladies would withdraw&mdash;he'd start to speak</span><br />
About old Lingard, while they passed the wine,<br />
<span class="pad1">And go on with the story for a week.</span><br />
No! We must have it clear. I much regret<br />
<span class="pad1">This violent tug-of-war between our aims</span><br />
But&mdash;I'm determined.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Have you finished yet?</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Right. Then you can, but I won't, marry James.</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Why not?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Why not? Answer my questions. One:<br />
Does he beat time to music with his hand?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Well&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Two: and talk of 'featuring,' 'Japs,' 'the Hun'?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Oh, sometimes&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Three: and does he understand</span><br />
That wicked frocks don't mean a wicked life?<br />
<span class="pad1">Four&mdash;&mdash;</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. But, of course, there's no one perfect!<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Four:</span><br />
Wouldn't he read the golf news to his wife?<br />
<span class="pad1">Five: Can he tell&mdash;the next day&mdash;what you wore?</span><br />
Six: If he knows an author, will he wait<br />
<span class="pad1">To get a copy free or buy the book?</span><br />
Seven: Is he fond of curate stories? Eight:<br />
<span class="pad1">If, when you're dressed, you wonder how you look</span><br />
And ask him, as you're driving to the dance,<br />
<span class="pad1">Doesn't he, after everything you've done,</span><br />
Say 'Oh, all right'&mdash;without a single glance?<br />
<span class="pad1">Nine: If you flirt a little, for the fun</span><br />
Of being a woman, would he think you light?<br />
<span class="pad1">Ten: Does he say, when dining in Soho,</span><br />
'I don't think we shall need champagne to-night&mdash;<br />
<span class="pad1">But if you really want it, let me know?'</span><br />
Eleven&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Oh please! I don't&mdash;in fact, I can't&mdash;<br />
<span class="pad1">Dispute the list. I'll openly admit</span><br />
That James is not the man I used to want....<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Splendid! Now, where's his wire? We'll answer it<br />
<span class="pad1">With one majestic 'No.'</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>stopping her</i>).<span class="pad4">Not yet. Be kind!</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Think what I lose in losing James, and then</span><br />
You'll change your mind&mdash;your portion of our mind.<br />
<span class="pad1">I want a man to kiss&mdash;&mdash;</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">But why not ten?<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. My dear! I want the life of modern man.<br />
<span class="pad1">I want to quote the works of Douglas Cole,</span><br />
Think all men base except the artisan,<br />
<span class="pad1">And smile at God, religion, and the soul.</span><br />
I want to find new genius everywhere.<br />
<span class="pad1">I want to sit in drawing-rooms and say</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
'Rossetti, Watts? Of course, they can't compare<br />
<span class="pad1">With Roger, or the smallest Fry, to-day.'</span><br />
So, won't you be an angel? Share the flat<br />
<span class="pad1">In honourable retirement! Don't you see</span><br />
You should?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Subconscious! Well, I may be that&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pad1">But no great eras come apart from me.</span><br />
What though to-day I have less power than you?<br />
<span class="pad1">The wheel will turn; and shall I not be there</span><br />
To run with roses down Fifth Avenue<br />
<span class="pad1">And make a Roman revel in Mayfair?</span><br />
No! I maintain my right to have a say<br />
<span class="pad1">In this, our marriage; therefore comprehend</span><br />
Once and for all that I shall not give way!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. I've done my best to treat you as a friend.<br />
You're just a little selfish pig! In fact,<br />
<span class="pad1">I don't know why you ever left your screen!</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. I didn't come to argue but to act,<br />
<span class="pad1">And now I will!</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">Whatever do you mean?<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHY. I came to kill you.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">What?<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">You see this knife?</span><br />
<span class="pad1">The ghost of Caesar Borgia gave me this,</span><br />
And with it some advice on taking life.<br />
<span class="pad1">He only wished, he said, the chance were his!</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. But don't you know? One's not allowed to kill.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Pooh! A mere whimsy of the Conscious Mind.<br />
Prepare!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. But listen!<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">No!<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad6">You can't!<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad8">I will!</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Pray to the gods whom Freud has left behind!</span><br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="fs70">DOROTHY</span> <i>lunges with the knife at</i> <span class="fs70">DOROTHEA</span>, <i>who escapes by darting to

<span class="pad1">Father-imago: schizophrenia&mdash;&mdash;</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Hence!</span><br />

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Wait, oh wait!<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Persona: hypermnesia: extrovert!<br />
Yield, in the holy names of Jung and Freud!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. I yield! I beg for nothing but fair play.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. How?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. By a simple plan that would avoid<br />
<span class="pad1">All further wrangling.</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">Well, what is it?<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad8">Say</span><br />
That you write half the telegram, and I<br />
<span class="pad1">The other half! That would be just.</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">Absurd!</span><br />
<span class="pad1">The first to write could give the whole reply.</span><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
DOROTHY. A woman, and you don't want the last word?...<br />
Toss!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>producing a coin</i>). If you lose, you're not to call me names.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Heads!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. You <i>have</i> lost. Who is the better now?...<br />
'Would you accept me for your husband.&mdash;James'&mdash;<br />
<span class="pad1">So runs the question, and the answer&mdash;&mdash;</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY (<i>anxiously</i>).<span class="pad4">How?<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Read it!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY (<i>in dismay</i>). 'Of course I would!'<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA.<span class="pad4">It's not so much</span><br />
<span class="pad1">That I want James, as that you've made me cross.</span><br />
In fact, if your behaviour had been such&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY (<i>who, after a little puzzling is now in the act of writing</i>).<br />
<span class="pad1">I'm glad to hear that you'll survive the loss.</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>in slow horror</i>). You've spoilt it! Let me see!... 'Of course I would....<br />
<span class="pad1">'Of course I would be damned first....' Little cat!</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Don't be a silly child. As if you could<br />
<span class="pad1">Abandon me for such a fool as that!</span><br />
O Zurich! O Vienna! Can you be<br />
<span class="pad1">So psychoanalytically dense</span><br />
As not to grasp that by considering me<br />
<span class="pad1">You gain a double health of spirit and sense?</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. I'll never find the man of my desire!<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Then break your heart over a silver birch.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. But this! No girl could send off such a wire.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY. Shock him&mdash;or else he'll get you to the church!<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
DOROTHEA. You're right. How often, and with how much pain,<br />
<span class="pad1">We burst a lock to find&mdash;an empty room!</span><br />
But that's all over. Let's be friends again<br />
<span class="pad1">And so stay always!</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Till the crack of doom....</span><br />
And here's <i>my</i> gage! Accept the knife I took<br />
<span class="pad1">From Borgia (how he'll rail at me, poor ghost!)</span><br />
And with it&mdash;cut the master's newest book.<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Where are you going?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY.<span class="pad4x">Going? To the post.<br /></span></p>

<p>DOROTHEA. Don't hurry. Stop awhile, and take from <i>me</i><br />
<span class="pad1">A pledge of golden friendship unalloyed&mdash;</span><br />
A cup of tea! With milk and sugar?<br /></p>

<p>DOROTHY (<i>with profound contempt</i>).<span class="pad2">Tea!</span><br />
<span class="pad1">'Oh, for a draught....' But here's to Jung!</span><br /></p>

<p>DOROTHEA (<i>raising her cup</i>).<span class="pad4">And Freud!</span><br />

<p class="noindent">SCENE. <i>A Garden. Entrance right and left. Left, a table and two chairs.</i>
(<i>The general effect should suggest a little lawn which leads outward in several
directions.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">(<i>The arrival of a taxicab is heard, off. Enter, left</i>, <span class="fs70">HILDA</span> <i>in summer hat
and dress and with a light cloak on her arm. She carries a folding-map and
a small book.</i>)</p>

<p>
HILDA (<i>speaking off, left</i>). What's that? 'The taximeter points,' you say,<br />
'To fifteen shillings'? Well, didn't I pay<br />
A pound? What? No, I <i>haven't</i> 'made a slip.'<br />
Surely five shillings was a handsome tip.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Sound of a motor-horn growing fainter.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="pad1">The creature's gone. These taxi-men!... But wait:</span><br />
Suppose that isn't really Merlin's Gate,<br />
Nor this the garden where a girl who loathes<br />
Our Twentieth Century (all except its clothes)<br />
May turn the Book of Time to any page<br />
And move within some more romantic age?<br />
The map will show. Yes, there's the gate, and there's<br />
That wall, that table, these two empty chairs....<br />
Everything's right. How wonderful, how splendid,<br />
To know that here the roar of time has ended!<br />
Now, let me see ... (<i>Consulting her map.</i>)<br />
<span class="pad8">If I should take that road</span><br />
What century should I have for my abode?<br />
'To Ancient Rome.' Lovely! (<i>She starts to go out, right. Then stops.</i>)<br />
<span class="pad8">It might be serious,</span><br />
Though, if I chanced on Nero or Tiberius.<br />
The Romans were rough diamonds.... This way here&mdash;<br />
So the map says&mdash;would lead me to the year<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Ten-sixty-six. I won't be such a fool<br />
As go back where I stuck so long at school.<br />
William the First was always dull. I know<br />
He'd make me listen to him&mdash;standing so,<br />
With Bayeux hands, knee crookèd, and neck bowed&mdash;<br />
While he read all the Domesday Book aloud.<br />
I shan't go there.... Now, that's a pretty view! (<i>Referring to the map.</i>)<br />
'The Eighteenth Century: Boswell Avenue.'<br />
I might try that. But no&mdash;that won't do either.<br />
I'd have to wear a wig or tell them why there,<br />
Love coffee-houses more than trees and birds,<br />
And talk in such tremendously long words.<br />
I know, I know! If I can find the way<br />
I'll wander back into the sumptuous day<br />
When, in his gardens near the warm lagoon,<br />
Titian gave feasts under the stars and moon.<br />
That would be heavenly! Those were noble times.<br />
There was a grandeur even about the crimes<br />
Of people like the Borgias ... and their dresses,<br />
And the sweet way they wore their hair in tresses,<br />
And&mdash;oh, and everything! What was Titian's date?<br />
I mustn't err into a time too late;<br />
But how to make quite sure? Suppose I took<br />
My bearings by this little precious book&mdash;<br />
Addington Symonds?... Oh, that I knew more!<br />
Was it in fifteen-sixty or before?<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Settling herself in one of the chairs she becomes absorbed in her book. Enter,
right</i>, <span class="fs70">GIOCONDA</span> <i>carrying two or three modern novels</i>.)</p>

<p>
GIOCONDA (<i>speaking off right</i>). I thank you, gondolier. You drowned my nurse<br />
With true dramatic finish. Take this purse.<br />
So&mdash;I am in that Garden where time speeds<br />
Backward or forward as our fancy needs.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
How sick I am of cloaks and ambuscades,<br />
Of poison, daggers, moonlight serenades,<br />
Of those dull dances that are all <i>I</i> trace&mdash;<br />
Pavane, lavolte, forlana, cinquepace&mdash;<br />
And the long pageant of our life at Venice!<br />
Now, in the Twentieth Century there is tennis,<br />
With cream and strawberries round a chestnut-tree,<br />
And day-long idling in the June-blue sea,<br />
And soda-fountains, too, and motor-cars,<br />
And Henley Weeks and Russian Ballet 'stars.'<br />
Oh, what a wealth of joy that century has!<br />
To think that I myself may learn to jazz!<br />
Truly, I judge it has no slightest flaw&mdash;<br />
The glorious age of Bennett, Wells, and Shaw.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She sets her books on the table and curtsies to them.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="pad1">Gramercy, gentlemen,&mdash;inasmuch as you,</span><br />
Here in your works, have taught me what to do,<br />
How to play hockey, smoke, and bob my hair<br />
In nineteen-twenty, when at last I'm there.<br />
Which path would bring me there, I wonder? How<br />
Choose of so many? If I'm near it now<br />
I ought to hear the roaring of their trains,<br />
Their motor-horns, their humming monoplanes....<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She listens intently for a moment.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="pad1">The very bees are silent....</span> (<i>Seeing</i> <span class="fs70">HILDA</span>.)<br />
<span class="pad10">Who is that?</span><br />
Surely, unless the books have lied, her hat<br />
Came from renowned 'Roulette's,' in Portman Square!<br />
A Twentieth-Century girl! <i>She</i> will know where<br />
The Spaniards gather and the Black Friars dwell.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Kissing her hand, right.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="pad1">Farewell, Rialto! Bridge of Sighs, farewell!</span><br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She goes up to</i> <span class="fs70">HILDA</span> <i>and curtsies ceremoniously</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
<span class="pad1">Dear Signorina.... Signorina.... Deep</span><br />
In Bennett's fragrant works,&mdash;&mdash;or can she sleep?<br />
Could <i>The Five Towns</i> have bored her? Let me try<br />
Once more. Most noble Signorina&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>HILDA (<i>starting up</i>).<span class="pad6">Why,</span><br />
Who are you, lady? By your dress and ways<br />
I think you must have come from Titian's days.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. Indeed, I do. Old Titian! How he talks!<br />
He did my portrait last July in chalks.<br />
But grant me the great liberty, I pray,<br />
Of asking what your name is&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">Hilda Gray.<br /></span></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. How sweet and to the point!<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">And yours?<br /></span></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">Gioconda</span><br />
Francesca Violante Giulia della Bionda.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. A poem in itself! The velvet verse<br />
Of Tasso is not softer to rehearse.<br />
What can have led you to forgo an age<br />
When life was an illuminated page<br />
From some superb romance?<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">And what, I wonder,</span><br />
Can have torn you and your fair time asunder?<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. I'll tell you, for I'm sure you'll sympathize.<br />
I have a lover&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">That is no surprise.<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA. And by the post this morning came a letter&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. From him?<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad4">From him.<br /></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">What could have happened better?<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA. Ah! naturally you think that Harry writes<br />
Of longing, suicide, and sleepless nights.<br />
Did he, I'd read his letters ten times over&mdash;<br />
But you don't know the Twentieth-Century lover.<br />
Oh, for a man who'd write through tears, all swimmily,<br />
And woo me with grand metaphor and simile!<br />
I couldn't bear the slang that Harry used<br />
In asking for my hand.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">So you refused!<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA. Yes, and came here to seek a braver time.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. How odd! <i>I</i> had a letter, all in rhyme,<br />
Brought by a lackey to my father's gate<br />
Just when dawn broke. As if I couldn't wait!<br />
He dashed up, panting; and his horse's mouth<br />
Was flecked with blood and foam....<br /></p>

<p>HILDA (<i>clasping her hands</i>). The passionate South!<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. The fellow gave the letter, gasped, went red,<br />
And straightway horse and lackey fell down dead.<br />
I scanned the note, observed the flowery phrases<br />
In which the writer smothered me with praises;<br />
Compared them with the style of Bernard Shaw,<br />
And told him straightway that he might withdraw.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. If I could see that letter!<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">So you shall,</span><br />
Sweet friend&mdash;or, rather, right you are, old pal.<br />
I'll read it.<span class="pad2">(<i>She produces a letter tied with rose-coloured ribbon.</i>)<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">Do!... I see his passion's flood</span><br />
Demands red ink.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">Oh dear no&mdash;that's his blood.</span><br />
Now, listen. Did you ever hear a style<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Quite so absurd? I call it simply vile.<span class="pad4">(<i>Reading.</i>)</span><br />

<p>HILDA. Gioconda, what a lover!<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">So <i>I</i> think&mdash;</span><br />
His brain a dictionary, his blood mere ink.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. <i>I</i> mean how rare a lover! Would that mine<br />

It is a shame! It really is too bad!<br />
'Dear Hilda'&mdash;plain 'dear!' And what girl could marry<br />
A man who, when proposing, ends 'yours, Harry?'<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. I love his downright manner. In my mind<br />
I see him, a tall figure; and behind,<br />
His old two-seater. Yes, I see him plainly&mdash;<br />
Close-cropped&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad4">Half bald.<br /></span></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">Slow-moving&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad8">And ungainly.<br /></span></p>

An eye like Bennett's and a beard like Shaw's.<br />
I know your Harry&mdash;just the English type,<br />

With so few words, except about machines,<br />
That he can never tell you what he means:<br />
But were <i>I</i> his, and we two went a-walking,<br />
What should that matter? <i>I</i> could do the talking.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. Surely you see, Gioconda, I require<br />
A lover who can make love with some fire.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. And I a lover so much overcome<br />
By deep emotion that it leaves him dumb.<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
HILDA. No poetry? Then, so far as I can tell,<br />
The Twentieth Century ought to suit you well....<br />

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad4">This: that you</span><br />

Up at the 'Varsity of that sort of stuff.<br />

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">Can't. Sorry. Told two men</span><br />
I'd play a foursome with them at 5.10.<br />
You'd better make the fourth.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">I really can't.</span><br />
There are some new delphiniums I <i>must</i> plant.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA (<i>going out, left</i>). See you to-morrow, then.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">You'll drive me frantic</span><br />
If you're not just the teeniest bit romantic!<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. It isn't done. You're absolutely wrong<br />
In asking me to do that stunt. So long!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She tosses the pipe and stick off, left.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pad1">There! Did I play it well? You'd be my wife?</span><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
HILDA (<i>sighing</i>). My dear, you played old Harry to the life&mdash;<br />
His gaucherie....<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">His noble self-command....<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA. The way he shifts his cane from hand to hand....<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. A nervous trick that shows how much he feels....<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. All I know is&mdash;I'd have a man who kneels<br />
And pours out passion in a style as rippling<br />
As the best Swinburne&mdash;or at least as Kipling.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. Then I'll now be <i>your</i> lady. To your part&mdash;<br />
Woo me as you'd be wooed!<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">With all my heart!</span><br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Catching up her cloak, she flings it over her shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="pad1">Last Miracle of the World, sainted, adored,</span><br />
Divine Gioconda&mdash;hear me, I beg!<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">My lord!<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA. Dost know of passion? Is that heart so pure<br />
As not to guess what torments I endure<br />
Who for so long have sighed for thee in vain?<br />
And wilt thou have no pity on my pain?<br />
Wilt thou still spurn me as a thing abhorred<br />
Whose only crime is to love thee?<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">My lord&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA. Stay! I will brook no answer. For thy sake<br />
Did I not paint the town in crimson-lake?<br />
Have I not wrenched thee through thy nunnery-bars?<br />
And bear I not some ninety-seven scars<br />
Taken as I fought my way to thy fair feet?<br />
Think how thy relatives rushed into the street<br />
To save thee&mdash;how I put them to the sword<br />
And left them strewn about in heaps!<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">My lord&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA. Had I a boy's light love when I, to win<br />
Thy favour, cut off all thy kith and kin?<br />
Run through the list! Measure my love by that!<br />
Two great-grandfathers (one, I own, was fat);<br />
Five brothers; fourteen uncles; half a score<br />
Of nephews (and I dare say even more);<br />
A brace of maiden-aunts; a second-cousin;<br />
And family connections by the dozen.<br />
Does it not melt that pitiless heart of ice<br />
To see thyself secured at such a price?<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. My lord&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad4">Or if indeed thy heart requires</span><br />
Flame fiercer than my love's Etnaean fires&mdash;<br />
Ask what thou wilt, but do not ask that I<br />
Live on. Command me, rather, how to die.<br />
Say in what style thou'dst have me perish here,<br />
So that at least my ardour win one tear!<br />
Choose what thou wilt&mdash;I'll execute thy charge&mdash;<br />
Nor fear to speak: my repertoire is large.<br />
I can suspend myself upon a rafter;<br />
Fall on my blade, and die with horrid laughter;<br />
Leap from a height; read Bennett's books; or swallow<br />
Poison&mdash;and, mark you, with no sweet to follow.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. My lord&mdash;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">Thy choice is made?<br /></span></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">My lord&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad10">Alack!<br /></span></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. I have accepted thee ten minutes back.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. Then&mdash;I will deign to live. My castle stands<br />
Four-towered among its olive-silvered lands.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Away! Away! Thou art all heaven to me!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She drags</i> <span class="fs70">GIOCONDA</span> <i>right. They break.</i>)</p>

<p>GIOCONDA. Wonderful! That's Pandolfo to a tee!<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. I should adore him!<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">And I Harry, too</span><br />
If only you were I and I were you!<br />
But soft! since here we stand beyond the range<br />
Of Time, why don't we swop?<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">You mean 'exchange'?</span><br />
Why not? We will!      (<i>Moving quickly, right.</i>)<br />
<span class="pad8">May Titian's age enfold me!</span><br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. Stop! Stop! You can't go yet. You haven't told me<br />
Where I can find the Twentieth Century.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA (<i>leading her front, and pointing to the audience</i>). Then,<br />
Behold its ladies and its gentlemen.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. What lovely people!... All the same, you know,<br />
They're not as I have pictured them.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">How so?<br /></span></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. They're all so still.... And then&mdash;my fancy boggles<br />
To see not one who's wearing motor-goggles.<br />
How can I get among them?<br /></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">You must jump</span><br />
Down there.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">But that would mean a dreadful bump!<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA. You want to go from fifteen-sixty sheer<br />
To nineteen-twenty. 'Tis a jump, my dear....<br />
And so&mdash;farewell! I come, I come at last&mdash;<br />
O fire and sound and perfumes of the Past! (<i>She goes out quickly, right.</i>)<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. Her eyes were green. However hard he tries,<br />
Pandolfo never can resist green eyes.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
I know he'll die for her and not for me.<br />
Why did I let her go? It shall not be!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="fs70">HILDA</span> <i>enters, right</i>.)</p>

<p>HILDA. It shall not be! Why did I let her go?<br />
Harry will love her more than me, I know.<br />
Gioconda!<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad4">Hilda!<br /></span></p>

<p>HILDA.<span class="pad6">Somehow, after all,</span><br />
I can't let Harry go beyond recall.<br />
I think of his good heart: I know how proud<br />
I'll be to watch him through a dusty cloud<br />
When his new car, balanced upon one tire,<br />
Rolls roistering through the lanes of Devonshire.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. I too, fair friend, perceive with sudden terror<br />
The greatness of my momentary error.<br />
I mustn't let you risk the enterprise....<br />
Pandolfo never could endure green eyes!<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. Let us each make the best of her own age!<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. But sometimes you will write me&mdash;just a page?<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. I will indeed. And you?<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA.<span class="pad6">And so will I.</span><br />
Hilda&mdash;farewell!<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. Gioconda, dear&mdash;good-bye!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Standing in the middle of the stage, they take hands and kiss. Then they
come to the front, left and right.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span class="pad1">So ends our fantasy&mdash;the slight design</span><br />
<span class="pad1">Arisen and gone like sound in summer trees,</span><br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. The burden such as every mind may seize&mdash;<br />
That in all centuries life is goodly wine!<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
HILDA. Which has the more of joy, her age or mine,<br />
We leave you to determine as you please.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. Mine has the painting-schools&mdash;the Sienese,<br />
Venetian and unchallenged Florentine.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. Mine has the knowledge that our mortal pains<br />
Are fleeing from the skilled physician's arts.<br /></p>

<p>GIOCONDA. Mine the delight of unspoiled hills and plains,<br />
Fair speech, adventure, and romantic hearts.<br /></p>

<p>HILDA. And mine a sense that, by the single sun<br />
That all men share, the world for man is one.<br />
